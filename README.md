# Gloomhaven Scenario Tree

This is a simple application to be able to easily visualize your Gloomhaven campaign state. The idea was to easily show what scenarios are currently available to your party, and to be able to track where those scenarios were unlocked from. For added convenience any scenario's pages can be viewed within the app so you can view / review any selected scenario. 

This applicaion was created with the help of the Gloomhaven Scenario Flowchart found here `https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/143772/scenario-flowchart`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Next steps

#### Implement way to merge JSON in case of updates to the static data
